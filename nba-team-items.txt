Each Magic Missile begins with this copy's fixed HP (1–3). Whenever a Magic Missile collides with another projectile, it loses 1 HP instead of being destroyed outright; when its HP is reduced to 0, that missile is removed from play. This lets higher-HP rolls survive more collisions and chew through opposing fire before disappearing.</div>

                   <div class="fd-row"><span class="fd-label fd-label-defense-effect">Defense effect:</span>When battle begins, create a castle energy shield with this copy's fixed HP (3–10). At the start of each quarter, for each stat row that still has at least one defense orb, energize the last orb in that row by adding +1 HP and marking it with an outer glow. Whenever the energy shield takes a hit from incoming damage, subtract that damage from the shield HP instead of primary castle HP, and for each such hit, randomly select up to this copy's fixed number of surviving defense orbs (1–3) across all rows and give each of them +1 HP and an outer glow refresh. Once the energy shield HP reaches 0, subsequent hits go directly to castle HP and no further re-energizes occur.</div>

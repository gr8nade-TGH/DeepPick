## 🔍 Cron Job Investigation

### Current Configuration (`vercel.json`)
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/auto-refresh-odds",
      "schedule": "*/15 * * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/auto-run-cappers",
      "schedule": "*/20 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### How to Verify Cron Jobs Are Running

#### 1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/deep-pick/deep-pick
2. Click "Deployments" → Select latest deployment
3. Click "Functions" tab
4. Look for `/api/auto-refresh-odds` and `/api/auto-run-cappers`
5. Check execution logs and timestamps

#### 2. **Check Vercel Logs**
1. In Vercel dashboard, click "Logs" (or "Runtime Logs")
2. Filter by function name
3. Look for the new logging format:
   ```
   ================================================================================
   🤖 [AUTO-REFRESH CRON] EXECUTION START: 2025-10-18T...
   ================================================================================
   ```

#### 3. **Check Database**
```sql
-- Check if odds_history is being populated
SELECT 
  DATE(captured_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as records
FROM odds_history
WHERE captured_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY DATE(captured_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Check if algorithm_runs is being logged
SELECT 
  capper,
  trigger_type,
  started_at,
  status,
  picks_generated
FROM algorithm_runs
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: CRON_SECRET

**The cron job for `/api/auto-run-cappers` REQUIRES `CRON_SECRET` to be set!**

#### To Set CRON_SECRET:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Navigate to: Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name:** `CRON_SECRET`
   - **Value:** Any secure random string (e.g., `your-secret-key-here`)
   - **Environments:** Production, Preview, Development
4. Redeploy the application

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED** - User needs to check/set this

## 🐛 Known Issues & Root Causes

### Issue #1: Inconsistent Odds Data
**Symptom:** Some games have more data points in their charts than others

**Root Cause:**
1. Games are only tracked from the moment they're first ingested
2. If a game is added late (e.g., 2 hours before start), it has less history
3. If cron jobs aren't running, no new data points are captured

**How to Verify:**
```sql
SELECT 
  g.id,
  g.home_team->>'name' as home,
  g.away_team->>'name' as away,
  g.created_at as game_added,
  COUNT(oh.id) as data_points,
  MIN(oh.captured_at) as first_capture,
  MAX(oh.captured_at) as last_capture
FROM games g
LEFT JOIN odds_history oh ON g.id = oh.game_id
WHERE g.status = 'scheduled'
GROUP BY g.id, g.home_team, g.away_team, g.created_at
ORDER BY data_points ASC;
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- If cron runs every 15 minutes
- And a game is added 24 hours before start
- It should have ~96 data points (24 * 4)

**Fix:**
1. Ensure cron jobs are running (check logs)
2. Verify CRON_SECRET is set
3. Monitor for 1-2 hours to see if new data points appear

### Issue #2: Cron Jobs May Not Be Running
**Symptom:** No new odds_history records, no algorithm_runs logs

**Possible Causes:**
1. CRON_SECRET not set (blocks `/api/auto-run-cappers`)
2. Vercel cron not configured properly
3. Deployment issue

**How to Verify:**
1. Check Vercel logs for cron execution
2. Look for the new logging format with timestamps
3. Check database for recent records

**Fix:**
1. Set CRON_SECRET in Vercel
2. Verify `vercel.json` is in root directory
3. Redeploy application
4. Monitor logs for 15-20 minutes

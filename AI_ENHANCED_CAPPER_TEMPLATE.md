# AI-Enhanced Capper System - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the complete pick generation process for AI-enhanced cappers. Each capper (Shiva, Ifrit, Cerberus, Nexus, DeepPick) follows this framework but with unique personality and factor preferences.

**Priority:** Best possible predictions (accuracy over speed/cost)

---

## System Architecture

### Cappers
1. **SHIVA** - Multi-Model Destroyer (Phase 1 implementation)
2. **IFRIT** - Aggressive Value Hunter
3. **CERBERUS** - Three-Headed Guardian
4. **NEXUS** - Pattern Recognition
5. **DEEPPICK** - Meta-Capper (weighs all other cappers' picks)

### AI Providers (Future: Named cappers by AI used)
- **Phase 1:** Perplexity (understand costs first)
- **Future:** GPT-4 Capper, Claude Capper, Gemini Capper (compare which AI is best at betting)

### Budget
- **Target:** $40/month
- **Maximum:** $100/month
- **Current:** Shiva only (scale after validation)
- **At Scale (5 cappers):** Need cost optimization

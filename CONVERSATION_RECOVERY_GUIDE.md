## üí¨ Conversation Summary (What We Discussed)

Based on the recovered fragments, here's what your previous conversation with Augment covered:

### Main Issue
- **Problem:** VS Code was crashing when using Augment AI extension
- **Initial Symptom:** Clicking Augment would cause Visual Studio Code to crash
- **Scope:** Started with one project, then affected both DeepPick App and TRE App

### Root Cause Identified
- **DeepPick App:** Had **35,857 files (509 MB)** - too many for Augment to index
- **Workspace Cache:** **719 MB of stale cached data** causing memory issues
- **File Watcher:** Checkpoints and build artifacts were being unnecessarily indexed

### Solutions Applied
1. ‚úÖ Created `.augmentignore` files in both projects to exclude:
   - `node_modules/` (dependencies)
   - `.next/`, `.vercel/` (build output)
   - `checkpoints/` (ML model data)
   
2. ‚úÖ Cleared workspace caches for both DeepPick App and TRE App
   - Deleted 2 workspace folders
   - Reduced cache from 719 MB to minimal size

3. ‚úÖ Updated VS Code settings
   - Verified memory limit was set to 32 GB
   - Configured file watcher exclusions

4. ‚úÖ Created optimization documentation:
   - `AUGMENT_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
   - `AUGMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md`
   - `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS_APPLIED.md`
   - `QUICK_START.md`

### Your System Specs
- **CPU:** Intel i9-14900KF (24 cores, 32 threads) üöÄ
- **RAM:** 64 GB ‚úÖ
- **Storage:** NVMe SSDs
- **OS:** Windows 11 Pro

### Questions You Asked
1. "Should I be using Augment AI in a different way?"
2. "Can we increase the specs allocated to VS Code or Augment AI?"
3. "Should I make a VS profile per project?"

**Answer:** No need for separate profiles - the `.augmentignore` fix works across all projects.

## üîç About Augment's Cloud Sync

### Important Information
**Augment does NOT have cloud sync for conversation history** (as of October 2025). Here's what this means:

- ‚ùå Conversations are stored **locally only** in LevelDB files
- ‚ùå No automatic backup to cloud servers
- ‚ùå No cross-device synchronization
- ‚úÖ Data is stored in: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\[workspace-id]\Augment.vscode-augment\augment-kv-store`

### Why This Matters
- If you clear workspace storage, conversations are deleted
- If you uninstall VS Code or Augment, conversations are lost
- If you switch computers, conversations don't transfer

### Recommendation
**Backup important conversations manually** by:
1. Copying the `augment-kv-store` folder periodically
2. Exporting important conversations to text files
3. Using the recovery script I created for future backups

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recovery Script Created

I've created a PowerShell script for you: `recover-augment-conversations.ps1`

### What It Does
- Scans all workspace storage directories for Augment data
- Extracts conversation fragments from LevelDB files
- Saves readable text files with conversation history
- Creates a summary report

### How to Use It Again
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Tucke\OneDrive\Desktop\DeepPick App"
.\recover-augment-conversations.ps1
```

### When to Use It
- Before clearing workspace cache
- Before uninstalling VS Code or Augment
- To create periodic backups of conversations
- If you accidentally delete conversation data

---

## üìù Data Format Notes

### Why Fragments?
The recovered data appears as "fragments" because:
1. **LevelDB Format:** Augment uses LevelDB (a key-value database) to store conversations
2. **Binary Encoding:** Data is stored in binary format with UTF-8 text embedded
3. **Chunking:** Large conversations are split across multiple database entries
4. **Compression:** Some data may be compressed or encoded

### Data Quality
- ‚úÖ **Request messages** are mostly intact
- ‚úÖ **Response text** is mostly readable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some special characters may appear corrupted
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting (markdown, code blocks) may be lost
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Conversation order may need manual reconstruction

## üîê File Recovery Options

### Windows Recycle Bin
If you deleted workspace storage recently, check:
```
C:\$Recycle.Bin
```
Look for folders matching the workspace IDs.

### File Recovery Software
If data was permanently deleted, you could try:
- **Windows File History** (if enabled)
- **Recuva** (free file recovery tool)
- **EaseUS Data Recovery**
- **Disk Drill**

**Note:** File recovery works best if:
- Files were deleted recently (within hours/days)
- Disk hasn't been heavily used since deletion
- No disk defragmentation has occurred

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ **Review recovered files** in `recovered-conversations/` folder
2. ‚úÖ **Read the conversation fragments** to recall what was discussed
3. ‚úÖ **Keep the recovery script** for future use

### Future Prevention
1. **Backup Strategy:**
   - Run the recovery script monthly
   - Save important conversations to separate text files
   - Consider copying the entire `augment-kv-store` folder periodically

2. **Before Clearing Cache:**
   - Always run the recovery script first
   - Export any important conversations
   - Check if you really need to clear all workspace storage

3. **Alternative:**
   - Only clear specific workspace folders, not all of them
   - Use VS Code's "Clean Workspace" instead of manual deletion

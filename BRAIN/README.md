#  DeepPick Brain - AI Agent Knowledge Base

**Purpose:** Fast onboarding for new Augment AI agents  
**Location:** C:\Users\Tucke\Documents\augment-projects\Optimize Projects\DeepPick_BRAIN  
**Maintained by:** Brain Agent (specialized AI assistant)

---

##  What's Inside

### 1. **NEW_AGENT_PROMPT.md**  START HERE
**Purpose:** Copy-paste this to new Augment agents for instant context  
**Contains:**
- Current focus (what's being worked on RIGHT NOW)
- Just completed features
- Tech stack overview
- Key code locations
- Known issues (what NOT to waste time on)
- What NOT to do (past decisions)
- Recent major changes (last 7 days)

**How to Use:**
1. Open NEW_AGENT_PROMPT.md
2. Copy entire contents
3. Paste into new Augment chat
4. Agent is ready in 30 seconds

---

### 2. **DECISION_LOG.md**
**Purpose:** Historical record of "why" decisions were made  
**Contains:**
- Architectural decisions (BLKSTL, Battle Bets as separate app)
- AI & prediction decisions (hallucination prevention, confidence recalibration)
- Database decisions (materialized views)
- UI/UX decisions (item popup workflow)
- Technical decisions (rate limiting, collision detection)

**How to Use:**
- Read when you need deep context on "why things are the way they are"
- Reference when making similar decisions
- Update when major architectural decisions are made

---

### 3. **UPDATE_LOG.md**
**Purpose:** Track when brain was last updated  
**Contains:**
- Update history with timestamps
- Commits analyzed
- Key findings from each update
- Brain statistics

**How to Use:**
- Check to see if brain is up-to-date
- See what changed in last update
- Track brain maintenance

##  Quick Start Guide

### For New AI Agents
1. Read NEW_AGENT_PROMPT.md (2 minutes)
2. Ask user: "What should I work on?"
3. Use codebase-retrieval to understand specific code
4. Start working

### For Updating the Brain
1. Open Augment chat with Brain Agent
2. Say: **"Update brain"**
3. Brain Agent analyzes recent commits
4. Brain Agent updates all files
5. Done (30 seconds)

##  Why This Brain Exists

### The Problem
- Augment AI agents get slow after long conversations (known issue)
- You spawn new agents frequently
- New agents need context to be effective
- Doing codebase-retrieval every time takes 25+ minutes

### The Solution
- Brain provides **temporal context** (what's happening NOW)
- Brain provides **decision history** (why things are the way they are)
- Brain provides **known issues** (what NOT to waste time on)
- New agents get context in **30 seconds** instead of 25 minutes

### What Brain is NOT
-  Not a duplicate of the codebase
-  Not a copy of existing docs
-  Not static architecture diagrams
-  **Temporal context** that changes frequently
-  **Decision history** that prevents repeating mistakes
-  **Fast onboarding** for new agents

---

##  Brain Statistics

- **Files:** 4 (NEW_AGENT_PROMPT, DECISION_LOG, UPDATE_LOG, README)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-11-24
- **Commits Analyzed:** 20 (last 7 days)
- **Update Frequency:** Every 2-3 days or after major milestones

---

##  Maintenance

### When to Update
- After completing major features
- When focus shifts to new work
- After making architectural decisions
- Every 2-3 days (keep brain fresh)

### How to Update
Just say to Brain Agent: **"Update brain"**

### Who Maintains
- **Brain Agent** - Specialized AI assistant (read-only access to repo)
- **You** - Can manually edit files if needed

---

##  Brain Agent Role

**What Brain Agent Does:**
-  Monitors GitHub repository (read-only)
-  Maintains brain files
-  Analyzes commits and updates context
-  Provides fast onboarding for new agents

**What Brain Agent Does NOT Do:**
-  Push to GitHub
-  Modify working repository
-  Make code changes
-  Make decisions (only documents them)

##  Example Usage

### Scenario: You spawn a new AI agent

**Without Brain (Old Way):**
`
You: "Help me fix the Quarter Debug Controls positioning issue"
Agent: "Let me analyze the codebase..."
[25 minutes of codebase-retrieval]
Agent: "I see you have a Battle Bets system. Should I work on that?"
You: "No, that's done. Just fix the debug controls."
[15 more minutes]
`

**With Brain (New Way):**
`
You: [Paste NEW_AGENT_PROMPT.md]
Agent: "I see Quarter Debug Controls has 9+ fix attempts. Should I continue?"
You: "Yes"
Agent: [Starts working immediately]
`

**Time Saved:** 40 minutes  30 seconds

##  You're Ready!

The brain is set up and ready to use. Next time you spawn a new AI agent:

1. Open NEW_AGENT_PROMPT.md
2. Copy-paste to new agent
3. Start working immediately

**Questions?** Ask Brain Agent: "How do I use the brain?"

**Brain Status:**  Active and Ready

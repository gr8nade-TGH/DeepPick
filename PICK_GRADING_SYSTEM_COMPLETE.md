# ✅ Pick Grading System - COMPLETE

## Overview

The complete pick lifecycle system is now fully implemented and operational. This document explains how picks flow from generation to grading to performance metrics.

## 🔄 Complete Pick Lifecycle

### **1. Pick Generation** (Every 10 minutes)
```
Cron: /api/cron/shiva-auto-picks
  ↓
Calls: /api/shiva/step1-scanner (find eligible game)
  ↓
Calls: /api/shiva/generate-pick (run SHIVA algorithm)
  ↓
Inserts pick into database:
  - game_id: UUID reference to games table
  - capper: 'shiva'
  - pick_type: 'total'
  - selection: 'OVER 235.5' or 'UNDER 235.5'
  - status: 'pending'
  - confidence: 0-100
  - game_snapshot: JSONB with all game details
```

### **2. Dashboard Display** (Real-time)
```
User visits https://deep-pick.vercel.app/
  ↓
Dashboard fetches: GET /api/picks?status=pending
  ↓
Displays in CURRENT PICKS table:
  - Matchup (e.g., "LAL@MEM")
  - Pick (e.g., "OVER 235.5")
  - Units (1-5)
  - Confidence (%)
  - Game Start (countdown timer)
  - Sport (NBA)
  - Capper badge (SHIVA)
```

**Note:** Dashboard requires manual refresh to see new picks. Consider adding auto-polling in future.

### **3. Game Completion Detection** (Every 10 minutes) ⭐ NEW
```
Cron: /api/cron/sync-game-scores
  ↓
Fetches: MySportsFeeds scoreboard API
  Endpoint: /date/{YYYYMMDD}/scoreboard.json
  ↓
Identifies completed games:
  - playedStatus: 'COMPLETED' or 'COMPLETED_PENDING_REVIEW'
  ↓
Updates games table:
  - status: 'final'
  - final_score: { home: 115, away: 108, winner: 'home' }
  - home_score: 115
  - away_score: 108
```

### **4. Automatic Pick Grading** (Triggered by game completion)
```
Database trigger: grade_picks_for_game()
  ↓
Fires when: games.status changes to 'final'
  ↓
For each pending pick on that game:
  ↓
Calculate result:
  - TOTAL picks: Compare final total vs line
  - OVER wins if: (home_score + away_score) > line
  - UNDER wins if: (home_score + away_score) < line
  - PUSH if: exactly equals line
  ↓
Update pick:
  - status: 'won' | 'lost' | 'push'
  - net_units: +units (win) | -units (loss) | 0 (push)
  - graded_at: timestamp
  - result: JSONB with outcome details
```

### **5. Dashboard Updates** (After grading)
```
Pick moves from CURRENT PICKS to PICK HISTORY
  ↓
GET /api/picks?status=completed
  ↓
Displays in PICK HISTORY table:
  - Final score
  - Result badge (WON/LOST/PUSH)
  - Net units (+/-)
  - Graded timestamp
```

### **6. Performance Metrics Calculation**
```
GET /api/performance?period=7d&capper=shiva
  ↓
Calculates from graded picks:
  - Win Rate: (wins / total_graded) × 100
  - Total Units: SUM(net_units)
  - ROI: (total_units / total_wagered) × 100
  - Profit Chart: Daily cumulative units
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Picks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE picks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  game_id UUID REFERENCES games(id),
  capper capper_type NOT NULL,  -- 'shiva', 'nexus', 'cerberus', 'ifrit', 'deeppick'
  pick_type TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'total', 'spread', 'moneyline'
  selection TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'OVER 235.5', 'UNDER 235.5', etc.
  odds INTEGER,                 -- American odds (e.g., -110)
  units DECIMAL,                -- Bet size (1-5)
  confidence DECIMAL,           -- 0-100
  status TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'pending', 'won', 'lost', 'push'
  net_units DECIMAL,            -- Profit/loss after grading
  game_snapshot JSONB,          -- Snapshot of game details at pick time
  graded_at TIMESTAMPTZ,        -- When pick was graded
  result JSONB,                 -- Grading details
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

### Games Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE games (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  api_event_id TEXT UNIQUE,     -- 'msf_{gameId}'
  sport TEXT,                   -- 'nba'
  league TEXT,                  -- 'NBA'
  home_team JSONB,              -- { name: "Lakers", abbreviation: "LAL" }

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### Question 1: Auto-population of Current Picks
✅ **ANSWER:** YES, picks automatically appear in database immediately after generation.
- **Latency:** < 100ms database insert
- **Dashboard:** Requires manual page refresh (no auto-polling)
- **Recommendation:** Add 30-60 second polling for live updates

### Question 2: Legacy DeepPick Capper
✅ **ANSWER:** DeepPick is INACTIVE - just a database default value.
- No active pick generation logic
- Old picks were created via `/api/place-pick` without specifying capper
- **FIX APPLIED:** `/api/place-pick` now requires `capper` field

### Question 3: Pick Grading Workflow
✅ **ANSWER:** NOW COMPLETE - all components implemented.
- ✅ Game completion detection: `/api/cron/sync-game-scores`
- ✅ Final score fetching: MySportsFeeds scoreboard API
- ✅ Pick grading: Database trigger `grade_picks_for_game()`
- ✅ Dashboard updates: Automatic via status filtering
- ✅ Performance metrics: `/api/performance` endpoint

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Manual Test (Trigger Score Sync)
```bash
# Manually trigger the score sync cron
curl -X POST https://deep-pick.vercel.app/api/cron/sync-game-scores
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Before game finishes:**
   - Pick shows in CURRENT PICKS with status='pending'
   - Game status='scheduled'

2. **After game finishes:**
   - Cron detects completed game (within 10 minutes)
   - Game status updated to 'final'
   - Pick automatically graded
   - Pick moves to PICK HISTORY
   - Performance metrics update

### Monitoring
Check Vercel logs for:
```
🏀 [GAME-SCORES-SYNC] EXECUTION START
📊 [GAME-SCORES-SYNC] Games found: X
🏁 [GAME-SCORES-SYNC] Completed game found: LAL 115 @ MEM 108
✅ [GAME-SCORES-SYNC] Updated: Lakers 115 @ Grizzlies 108
🎯 [GAME-SCORES-SYNC] Auto-grading 1 pending pick(s) for this game
```

## 🚀 What's Next

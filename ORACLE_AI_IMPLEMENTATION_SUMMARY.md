## üîÆ How Oracle Works

### 1. Deep Web Research (Perplexity API)
```typescript
const research = await perplexity.researchMatchup(
  homeTeam, awayTeam, sport, gameDate,
  { useProSearch: true, recencyFilter: 'week' }
)
```

Oracle searches the web for:
- Recent team form and performance
- Injury reports and lineup changes
- Head-to-head history
- Weather conditions
- Betting trends and line movement
- Expert analyst opinions

### 2. AI Analysis & Prediction
```typescript
const recommendation = await perplexity.getBettingRecommendation(
  homeTeam, awayTeam, sport, gameDate, 
  currentOdds, research, capperPersonality
)
```

AI then:
- Assigns weights to factors (recent form: 20%, injuries: 15%, vegas comparison: 30%, etc.)
- Predicts the game score
- Compares prediction to Vegas odds
- Calculates confidence (1-10 scale)
- Recommends bet type and units

### 3. Decision Making

Oracle only makes a pick when:
- ‚úÖ Confidence ‚â• 7.0/10
- ‚úÖ Clear value vs Vegas odds
- ‚úÖ No duplicate pick type exists
- ‚úÖ Passes favorite rule (if applicable)

### 4. Units Allocation
- 7.0-7.9 confidence ‚Üí 1 unit
- 8.0-8.9 confidence ‚Üí 2 units
- 9.0-9.4 confidence ‚Üí 3 units
- 9.5-9.7 confidence ‚Üí 4 units
- 9.8+ confidence ‚Üí 5 units

## üíæ Database Schema

### New Columns in `picks` Table

```sql
ai_insight TEXT
-- Natural language explanation of the pick
-- Example: "The Lakers have dominated the Clippers in recent matchups, 
-- winning 7 of the last 10. LeBron's return from injury gives them a 
-- significant edge. Our model predicts a 8-point victory vs the 5.5 spread."

ai_research JSONB
-- Structured research data
{
  "summary": "Lakers vs Clippers analysis...",
  "insights": [
    "Lakers on 5-game win streak",
    "Clippers missing Kawhi Leonard"
  ],
  "injuries": [
    {"team": "LAC", "player": "Kawhi Leonard", "status": "Out"}
  ],
  "sources": [
    {"url": "espn.com/...", "title": "Lakers dominate Clippers", "snippet": "..."}
  ]
}

factors_analyzed JSONB
-- Weighted factors that influenced the decision
{
  "recent_form": {
    "value": 75,
    "weight": 20,
    "impact": "Home team on 5-game win streak"
  },
  "injuries": {
    "value": 60,
    "weight": 15,
    "impact": "Away team missing starting player"
  },
  "vegas_comparison": {
    "value": 85,
    "weight": 30,
    "impact": "Our prediction shows 8-point edge"
  }
}

ai_model_version TEXT
-- Example: 'perplexity-sonar-pro'
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Setup

1. Get Perplexity API key: https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api
2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Oracle generated 3 AI-powered picks",
  "picks": [...],
  "analysis": [
    {
      "selection": "Lakers -5.5",
      "confidence": 8.5,
      "units": 2,

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Per-Pick Costs
- **Research call**: ~$0.01-0.03 (Perplexity Sonar Pro)
- **Recommendation call**: ~$0.01-0.02 (Perplexity Sonar Pro)
- **Total**: ~$0.02-0.05 per pick

### Monthly Estimates
- **Conservative** (3 picks/day): ~$1.80-4.50/month
- **Moderate** (10 picks/day): ~$6-15/month
- **Aggressive** (30 picks/day): ~$18-45/month

### Cost Optimization
- Use standard `sonar` model instead of `sonar-pro` (~5x cheaper)
- Reduce max picks per run (currently 3)
- Run less frequently (daily vs hourly)
- Enable only for specific high-value sports

## üìä Monitoring Performance

### Compare Oracle to Other Cappers

```sql
SELECT 
  capper,
  COUNT(*) as total_picks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as wins,
  ROUND(AVG(confidence), 2) as avg_confidence,
  SUM(net_units) as total_units,
  ROUND(SUM(net_units)::NUMERIC / COUNT(*)::NUMERIC, 2) as avg_units_per_pick
FROM picks
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY capper
ORDER BY total_units DESC;
```

### Analyze Which Factors Lead to Wins

```sql
SELECT 
  jsonb_object_keys(factors_analyzed) as factor,
  AVG(CAST(factors_analyzed->jsonb_object_keys(factors_analyzed)->>'value' AS FLOAT)) as avg_value,
  AVG(CAST(factors_analyzed->jsonb_object_keys(factors_analyzed)->>'weight' AS FLOAT)) as avg_weight,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'won') as wins,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'lost') as losses,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'won')::NUMERIC / COUNT(*)::NUMERIC * 100, 1) as win_rate
FROM picks
WHERE capper = 'oracle' AND factors_analyzed IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY factor
ORDER BY win_rate DESC;
```

### View Oracle Insights

```sql
SELECT 
  p.id,
  g.away_team->>'name' || ' @ ' || g.home_team->>'name' as matchup,
  p.selection,
  p.confidence,
  p.units,
  p.status,
  p.net_units,
  p.ai_insight,
  p.factors_analyzed
FROM picks p
JOIN games g ON p.game_id = g.id
WHERE p.capper = 'oracle'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

## üîß Extending Oracle

### Add More AI Models

The architecture is designed to be model-agnostic. To add OpenAI, Claude, or other models:

1. **Create AI client** (e.g., `src/lib/ai/openai-client.ts`)
2. **Implement same interface**:
   - `researchMatchup()` - Use OpenAI + Tavily/Serper for search
   - `getBettingRecommendation()` - Use GPT-4 for analysis
3. **Update Oracle algorithm** to support multiple models
4. **A/B test** different models and compare performance

Example structure for OpenAI:
```typescript
// src/lib/ai/openai-client.ts
export class OpenAIClient {
  async researchMatchup(...) {
    // Use Tavily API for web search
    const searchResults = await tavily.search(query)
    
    // Use GPT-4 to analyze results
    const analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-4-turbo',
      messages: [...]
    })
    
    return parseResearch(analysis)
  }
  
  async getBettingRecommendation(...) {
    // Similar to Perplexity but with GPT-4
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Learning System (Future)

Next step is to make Oracle learn from past picks:

```typescript
// After game is graded
async function updateOracleWeights(pickId: string) {
  const pick = await getPick(pickId)
  const factors = pick.factors_analyzed
  
  // If pick won, increase weight of high-value factors
  // If pick lost, decrease weight of high-value factors
  
  await updateModelWeights({
    capper: 'oracle',
    version: pick.ai_model_version,
    adjustments: calculateAdjustments(pick)
  })
}
```

Store model versions and weights in database:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_model_versions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  capper TEXT NOT NULL,
  version TEXT NOT NULL,
  factor_weights JSONB NOT NULL,
  performance_metrics JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## ü§ù Integration with Existing System

Oracle integrates seamlessly:

‚úÖ Uses same `CapperGame` and `CapperPick` types  
‚úÖ Works with duplicate checker  
‚úÖ Logs to `algorithm_run_logs` table  
‚úÖ Follows same confidence/units system  
‚úÖ Respects favorite odds rules  
‚úÖ Shows up in leaderboard with other cappers  

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY not set"
- Add key to `.env.local`
- Restart dev server

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Add delays between picks (already implemented: 1s)
- Upgrade Perplexity plan
- Reduce max picks

### "Failed to parse AI recommendation"
- AI returned invalid JSON
- Check logs for raw response
- Lower temperature for more consistent output (currently 0.3)

### Picks always PASS
- AI might be too conservative
- Lower confidence threshold (currently 7.0)
- Adjust prompts to be more aggressive

## üìà Next Steps

### Phase 2: Multi-Model Ensemble
- Add OpenAI GPT-4 option
- Add Anthropic Claude option
- Compare models and combine predictions

### Phase 3: Learning System
- Track factor effectiveness
- Auto-adjust weights based on wins/losses
- Model versioning and A/B testing

### Phase 4: Real-Time Adaptation
- Live game analysis
- In-game betting recommendations
- Dynamic odds tracking

## üéì Key Learnings

1. **AI for sports betting is powerful** - Real-time research + analysis finds edges
2. **Prompt engineering matters** - Specific prompts with JSON schema = consistent output
3. **Cost management is crucial** - Use limits, delays, and model selection
4. **Transparency builds trust** - Show sources, factors, and reasoning
5. **Hybrid approach works best** - Combine AI insights with deterministic rules

## üôè Credits

# Visit: https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api

# Add to .env.local
echo "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your-key-here" >> .env.local

# Run migration
npx supabase db push

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run Oracle

**Option A: Via UI**

2. Click "✨ Run Oracle AI"
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for AI analysis
4. View picks with full insights!

**Option B: Via API**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/run-oracle
```

Uncomment Oracle in `src/app/api/auto-run-cappers/route.ts`

### 3. View Results

**In Dashboard:**
- Oracle picks show up alongside other cappers
- Click any pick to see AI insight in popup

**In Database:**
```sql
-- View latest Oracle picks with insights
SELECT 
  p.selection,
  p.confidence,
  p.units,
  p.status,
  p.ai_insight,
  p.factors_analyzed
FROM picks p
WHERE p.capper = 'oracle'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Per-Pick Cost
- **Research call**: $0.01-0.03
- **Recommendation call**: $0.01-0.02
- **Total**: ~$0.02-0.05 per pick

### Monthly Estimates
With current settings (max 3 picks per run):

- **Daily runs**: 3 picks × $0.03 × 30 days = **$2.70/month**
- **Twice daily**: 6 picks × $0.03 × 30 days = **$5.40/month**
- **Hourly**: 72 picks × $0.03 × 30 days = **$64.80/month**

### Cost Optimization
- ✅ Currently limited to 3 picks per run
- ✅ 1-second delay between games
- ✅ Only analyzes games with odds
- ⚠️ Consider using standard `sonar` instead of `sonar-pro` (5x cheaper)

## 📊 Performance Tracking

### Compare to Other Cappers

After a week of picks, run:
```sql
SELECT 
  capper,
  COUNT(*) as picks,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'won' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as wins,
  ROUND(AVG(confidence), 2) as avg_conf,
  SUM(net_units) as units
FROM picks
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY capper
ORDER BY units DESC;
```

### Analyze Factor Effectiveness
```sql
SELECT 
  jsonb_object_keys(factors_analyzed) as factor,
  AVG(CAST(factors_analyzed->jsonb_object_keys(factors_analyzed)->>'weight' AS FLOAT)) as avg_weight,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'won')::FLOAT / COUNT(*) * 100 as win_rate
FROM picks
WHERE capper = 'oracle'
GROUP BY factor
ORDER BY win_rate DESC;
```

## 🎓 Key Architecture Decisions

### Why Perplexity?
- **Pro**: Built-in web search (no separate API needed)
- **Pro**: Good at sports analysis
- **Pro**: Reasonable pricing
- **Con**: Smaller model than GPT-4/Claude

**Decision**: Best starting point. Can add others later.

### Why JSON Responses?
- **Pro**: Structured, parseable data
- **Pro**: Easy to store in database
- **Pro**: Consistent format
- **Con**: Requires careful prompt engineering

**Decision**: Worth the effort for reliability.

### Why 7+ Confidence Threshold?
- **Pro**: Ensures quality picks
- **Pro**: Matches other cappers
- **Pro**: Cost control (fewer picks)
- **Con**: Might miss some +EV plays

**Decision**: Can be adjusted based on performance.

### Why Max 3 Picks Per Run?
- **Pro**: Cost control
- **Pro**: Quality over quantity
- **Pro**: Faster execution
- **Con**: Might miss some opportunities

**Decision**: Good starting point. Increase after validation.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"PERPLEXITY_API_KEY not set"**
- Add to `.env.local` and restart server

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Perplexity has rate limits
- Delays already implemented (1s between picks)
- Upgrade plan if needed

**"Failed to parse AI recommendation"**
- AI returned invalid JSON
- Check logs for raw response
- May need prompt adjustment

**"Oracle always passes"**
- AI is being too conservative
- Lower confidence threshold in code
- Adjust prompts to be more aggressive

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these over the first month:

1. **Win Rate**: Should be ≥55% for long-term profitability
2. **ROI**: Net units / total units risked
3. **Confidence Correlation**: Higher confidence → higher win rate?
4. **Factor Effectiveness**: Which factors predict wins?
5. **Cost per Win**: Total API costs / wins
6. **Time to Generate**: Average seconds per pick

# 🛡️ How to Prevent Deployment Errors

**Problem:** We've been spending 80% of our time fixing deployment errors because TypeScript errors only show up during Vercel builds.

**Solution:** Run type checks **locally** before pushing to Git.

---

## 🚀 **Quick Method (Recommended)**

### **Before Every Push:**

1. **Double-click** `check-before-push.bat` in your project folder
2. **Wait for checks to complete** (~10-30 seconds)
3. If you see ✅ **"ALL CHECKS PASSED!"** → Safe to push!
4. If you see ❌ errors → **Fix them first**, then run again

---

## 📝 **Manual Method**

### **Run these commands before pushing:**

```powershell
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Check for linter warnings
npm run lint
```

---

## 🎯 **What the Script Checks:**

### **1. TypeScript Type Checking**
- Catches `'pick' is possibly 'null'` errors
- Catches missing imports
- Catches type mismatches
- **Same checks that Vercel runs!**

### **2. ESLint Linting**
- Code quality issues
- Best practice violations
- Unused variables

---

## 🔧 **How It Works:**

The `check-before-push.bat` script runs:

```batch
npm run type-check  # TypeScript compiler in "check-only" mode
npm run lint        # ESLint checks
```

These are **the exact same checks** that Vercel runs during deployment, so if they pass locally, they'll pass on Vercel!

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

### **Ignore Checkpoint Errors**
You might see errors in `checkpoints/` folder - these are old backup files and can be ignored. Only fix errors in `src/` folder.

### **Common Errors:**

#### **"'X' is possibly 'null'"**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD
const value = obj.property

// ✅ GOOD
if (!obj) return
const value = obj.property

// ✅ ALSO GOOD
const value = obj?.property
```

#### **"Cannot find module"**
- Check your import path
- Make sure the file exists
- Verify the export exists

---

## 📊 **Time Savings:**

**Before:** 5-10 failed deployments × 3 minutes each = **15-30 minutes wasted**  
**After:** 1 local check × 30 seconds = **30 seconds, done right!**

**80% time savings!** 🎉

---

## 🎯 **Workflow:**

```
1. Make code changes
2. Run check-before-push.bat    ← NEW STEP!
3. Fix any errors
4. git add, commit, push
5. ✅ Deployment succeeds!
```

---

## 🆘 **If Errors Persist:**

1. Delete `.next` folder: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next`
2. Reinstall: `npm install`
3. Run check again: `npm run type-check`

**Remember: 30 seconds of local checking saves 30 minutes of deployment debugging!** ⏱️

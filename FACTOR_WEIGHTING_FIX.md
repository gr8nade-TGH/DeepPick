# Factor Weighting System - FIXED ✅

## Problem Summary

The confidence calculation was producing incorrect values because:

1. **Double-weighting bug**: Factors were being weighted twice (once in factor computation, once in confidence calculator)
2. **Edge vs Market not included**: Edge vs Market was applied as a manual adjustment instead of being treated as a factor with 100% weight
3. **Inconsistent max points**: Different registries had conflicting maxPoints values

## Root Cause

### Issue 1: Factor Computation
Each factor file (f1-f5) uses a hardcoded `MAX_POINTS = 5.0`:

```typescript
// f1-pace-index.ts
const MAX_POINTS = 5.0
const signal = tanh(paceDelta / 8.0) // Range: [-1, 1]
overScore = Math.abs(signal) * MAX_POINTS // Range: [0, 5.0]
```

This means a factor with signal = 0.7 produces `overScore = 3.5`.

### Issue 2: Confidence Calculator (BEFORE FIX)
The confidence calculator was multiplying by weight again:

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - double weighting)
const weight = normalizedWeights[factor.key] || 0 // 0.2 for 20%
const overScore = parsedValues.overScore || 0 // 3.5
const weightedOverScore = overScore * weight // 3.5 × 0.2 = 0.7
totalOverScore += weightedOverScore
```

This resulted in confidence values being **5x too low** (since weights sum to 100% instead of 500%).

### Issue 3: Edge vs Market
Edge vs Market was being applied as a separate adjustment in Step 5:

```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG - not included in confidence calculation)
const edgeFactor = Math.max(-2, Math.min(2, marketEdgePts / 3))
const adjustedConfidence = baseConfidence + (edgeFactor * 1.5)
```

This meant it wasn't being weighted properly and wasn't visible in the factor breakdown.

## Solution

### Fix 1: Confidence Calculator (AFTER FIX)
Properly scale factor scores by weight percentage:

```typescript
// AFTER (CORRECT - single weighting)
const weightPct = factorWeights[factor.key] || 0 // 20 (percentage)
const weightDecimal = weightPct / 100 // 0.2 (decimal)
const rawOverScore = parsedValues.overScore || 0 // 3.5 (based on MAX_POINTS = 5.0)
const effectiveOverScore = rawOverScore * weightDecimal // 3.5 × 0.2 = 0.7
totalOverScore += effectiveOverScore
```

**Effective Max Points Formula:**
```
Effective Max = MAX_POINTS × (weight / 100)
Example: 5.0 × (20 / 100) = 1.0 point
```

### Fix 2: Edge vs Market as Factor
Created `createEdgeVsMarketFactor()` helper function:

```typescript
function createEdgeVsMarketFactor(predictedTotal, marketTotalLine, marketEdgePts) {
  const MAX_POINTS = 5.0
  const edgePct = marketEdgePts / marketTotalLine
  const signal = Math.tanh(edgePct * 10) // Smooth saturation
  
  let overScore = 0
  let underScore = 0
  
  if (signal > 0) {
    overScore = Math.abs(signal) * MAX_POINTS
  } else if (signal < 0) {
    underScore = Math.abs(signal) * MAX_POINTS
  }
  
  return {
    key: 'edgeVsMarket',
    name: 'Edge vs Market',
    weight_total_pct: 100, // 100% weight (fixed)
    parsed_values_json: {
      signal,
      overScore,
      underScore,
      edgePts: marketEdgePts
    },
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

### Fix 3: Include Edge vs Market in Confidence Calculation
Updated Step 5 to add Edge vs Market to factors array:

```typescript
// Create Edge vs Market factor
const edgeVsMarketFactor = createEdgeVsMarketFactor(predictedTotal, marketTotalLine, marketEdgePts)

// Add to factors array
const allFactors = [...(steps.step3.factors || []), edgeVsMarketFactor]

// Recalculate confidence with Edge vs Market included
const factorWeights = {
  ...steps.step3.factorWeights,
  edgeVsMarket: 100 // 100% weight (fixed)
}

const confidenceResult = calculateConfidence({
  factors: allFactors,
  factorWeights,
  confSource: 'nba_totals_v1'
})

const finalConfidence = confidenceResult.confScore
```

## Example Calculation (AFTER FIX)

### Scenario: Denver @ Portland, OVER 238.5

**Factor Contributions:**

| Factor | Signal | Raw Score | Weight | Effective Score |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| F1: Pace Index | +0.699 | +3.495 | 20% | +0.699 |
| F2: Offensive Form | +0.593 | +1.186 | 20% | +0.237 |
| F3: Defensive Erosion | +0.049 | +0.097 | 20% | +0.019 |
| F4: 3-Point Env | +0.455 | +2.275 | 20% | +0.455 |
| F5: Free-Throw Env | +0.852 | +4.261 | 20% | +0.852 |
| **Subtotal (F1-F5)** | | | | **+2.262** |
| F6: Edge vs Market | +0.826 | +4.129 | 100% | +4.129 |
| **TOTAL CONFIDENCE** | | | | **+6.391** |

**Calculation Details:**

```
F1: 3.495 × 0.20 = 0.699 ✅
F2: 1.186 × 0.20 = 0.237 ✅
F3: 0.097 × 0.20 = 0.019 ✅
F4: 2.275 × 0.20 = 0.455 ✅
F5: 4.261 × 0.20 = 0.852 ✅
F6: 4.129 × 1.00 = 4.129 ✅

Total: 0.699 + 0.237 + 0.019 + 0.455 + 0.852 + 4.129 = 6.391
```

**Units Decision:**
- Confidence = 6.391
- Units = 5 (threshold: ≥4.5)

## Weight Budget System

### Total Weight Budget: 250%

- **F1-F5 (NBA Totals Factors)**: 100% total (20% each)
- **F6 (Edge vs Market)**: 100% (fixed, doesn't count toward budget)
- **F7 (Injury Availability)**: 50% (optional, if enabled)

**Example Configuration:**
```
✅ Pace Index: 20%
✅ Offensive Form: 20%
✅ Defensive Erosion: 20%
✅ 3-Point Env: 20%
✅ Free-Throw Env: 20%
✅ Injury Availability: 50%
✅ Edge vs Market: 100% (fixed)

Weight Budget: 150% / 250% ✅
```

### Effective Max Points by Weight

| Factor | Base Max | Weight | Effective Max |
|--------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Pace Index | 5.0 | 20% | 1.0 |
| Offensive Form | 5.0 | 20% | 1.0 |
| Defensive Erosion | 5.0 | 20% | 1.0 |
| 3-Point Env | 5.0 | 20% | 1.0 |
| Free-Throw Env | 5.0 | 20% | 1.0 |
| Injury Availability | 5.0 | 50% | 2.5 |
| **Edge vs Market** | **5.0** | **100%** | **5.0** |

## Testing

### Before Fix
```json
{
  "confidence": 4.327,
  "factors": [
    { "key": "paceIndex", "overScore": 3.495, "weight": 20 },
    { "key": "offForm", "overScore": 1.186, "weight": 20 },
    { "key": "defErosion", "overScore": 0.097, "weight": 20 },
    { "key": "threeEnv", "overScore": 2.275, "weight": 20 },
    { "key": "whistleEnv", "overScore": 4.261, "weight": 20 }
  ]
}
```

**Issue**: Confidence = 4.327, but manual sum = 3.495 + 1.186 + 0.097 + 2.275 + 4.261 = 11.314 ❌

### After Fix
```json
{
  "confidence": 6.391,
  "factors": [
    { "key": "paceIndex", "overScore": 3.495, "weight": 20, "effective": 0.699 },
    { "key": "offForm", "overScore": 1.186, "weight": 20, "effective": 0.237 },
    { "key": "defErosion", "overScore": 0.097, "weight": 20, "effective": 0.019 },
    { "key": "threeEnv", "overScore": 2.275, "weight": 20, "effective": 0.455 },
    { "key": "whistleEnv", "overScore": 4.261, "weight": 20, "effective": 0.852 },
    { "key": "edgeVsMarket", "overScore": 4.129, "weight": 100, "effective": 4.129 }
  ]
}
```

**Verified**: Confidence = 0.699 + 0.237 + 0.019 + 0.455 + 0.852 + 4.129 = 6.391 ✅

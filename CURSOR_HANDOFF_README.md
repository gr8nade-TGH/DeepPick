# Handoff Packet — Capper Pages, Insight Card, and Pick Grading

**Files included:**
- `INSIGHT_CARD_SPEC_v1.md` — UI/UX and engineering spec
- `NBA_Factor_Library_v1.csv` — initial factor catalog (NBA)
- `SHIVA_profile_seed_v1.json` — seed profile JSON (NBA v1)
- `PICK_GRADING_MODULE_SPEC_v1.md` — grading pipeline spec

## Next dev steps (no Preview required)
1) Implement Insight Card component per spec (icons, sorting, bars, tooltips).
2) Add RESULTS placeholder that binds to `pick_results` once grading is live.
3) Prepare grading endpoints & tests per module spec (can use fixtures).

## Check-ins
- After Insight Card: screenshot + hover tooltips video
- After grading stub: API shape + fake grade injected into card
- Before write-mode linkage: confirm dashboard insert + audit fields
